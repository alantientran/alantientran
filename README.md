## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a rising senior at UT Austin studying Computer Science with a concentration in AI/ML and a minor in Statistics and Data Science. Through both coursework and hands-on projects, I've developed strong experience with deep learning, data science (Python, R), data analytics (Snowflake, Power BI, SQL), and full-stack web development.

I'm currently a software engineer for Project SEED. In this role I developed a backend NLP pipeline to score linguistic data and manage React websites for JsPsych research games and RA training scheduling. My ultimate goal is to apply my skills in software development and data science to build meaningful, impactful technology.

- 🔭 Current Projects: NLP Data Pipeline
- 🌱 Current focus: mastering Power BI

- 🍱 Fun fact: I dance with 2 dance groups at UT Austin (hip-hop/kpop) and I love connecting with people through food.
